# Customer Retention and Churn Analysis Dashboard

Built an end-to-end customer retention and churn analysis dashboard using Excel and Google Sheets to help businesses understand customer behavior, revenue health, and churn risks.

The project focuses on transforming raw customer data into actionable KPIs and insights using pivot tables, calculated fields, and interactive dashboards. The dashboard highlights customer activity, churn trends, retention patterns, customer lifetime value (CLV), and revenue performance in a clear, management-friendly format.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

* Design logical KPI frameworks
* Use pivot tables for real-world business analysis
* Present insights clearly for decision-makers

The dashboard is suitable for subscription-based businesses, SaaS, e-commerce, and service companies looking to improve retention and revenue.
